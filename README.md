# Stream Labs (Formerly Twitch Alerts) Socket
This is a simple example of how to connect to Stream Labs over WebSockets to get a live feed of follows, subscriptions, hosts, alerts, donations and bits.

## Getting Started
This package is currently not a module you can import but it is a fairly simple script. To get the script working you'll need to update the ```STREAM_TOKEN``` variable in the ```index.js``` file to be your API Access Token which can be found at http://streamlabs.com/dashboard/api-settings.
